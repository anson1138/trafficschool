		<h2>Careless Driving and Its Consequences</h2>
		
		<p>We noted earlier that operating a motor vehicle is the single most 
		dangerous thing that most people do every day. While this is true for 
		all drivers&mdash;even those who are cautious and 
		conscientious&mdash;it's especially true for those who are careless 
		or inattentive behind the wheel. Unfortunately for all of you careless 
		drivers, there are a myriad of potential consequences for those who 
		disregard their responsibility to operate a vehicle in a safe manner.</p>
		
		<h3>Damage to or Loss of a Vehicle</h3>
		
		<p>A motor vehicle is likely to be among the most expensive purchases 
		you'll make in your lifetime. Even those vehicles regarded as 
		"affordable small cars" can set you back well over $15,000; the more 
		exotic varieties easily sport prices north of six figures (Aston Martin, 
		Mr. Bond?). And it's rare to find even previously owned vehicles that 
		are a true bargain&mdash;unless they have high mileage or something 
		significant wrong with them. Suffering damage to or the loss of a 
		vehicle, then, can be financially crippling to the average person. And 
		that's before the inconvenience of having to do without a vehicle for 
		a time has been factored in.</p>
		
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Car_Wreck.jpg" alt="Car Wreck" />
		</div>
		
		<p>Yet, damage to your vehicle, from a tiny scratch to a complete loss, 
		is a distinct possibility when vehicles are operated in a careless 
		manner. And it's not just <em>your</em> vehicle: If any damage was 
		caused by your careless driving, you'll be responsible for ensuring that 
		anything else you damaged&mdash;including others' expensive 
		vehicles&mdash;is repaired or replaced as well.</p>
		
		<p>Of course, you can lose your vehicle in more ways than by getting 
		into a crash. California traffic laws stipulate situations in which a 
		vehicle may be seized and impounded by authorities:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol and/or 
				other drugs</li>
				<li>possession of an alcoholic beverage in the vehicle when you 
				are under the age of 21</li>
				<li>conviction for engaging in a motor vehicle speed contest</li>
				<li>conviction for exhibition of speed on a highway</li>
				<li>operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver license</li>
				<li>allowing an unlicensed person to drive your vehicle</li>
				<!--CVC 14607.6-->
				<li>failing to provide proof of financial responsibility upon
				the request of a law enforcement officer (at the discretion of 
				the court)</li>
				<!--CVC 16029-->
				<li>leaving your vehicle in an unsafe place after a collision 
				(unless it is disabled)</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>While "losing" your vehicle in this manner is generally a temporary 
		situation, it's likely to be expensive to retrieve it from the impound 
		yard. And you will undoubtedly be greatly inconvenienced during the time 
		it's gone.</p>
		
		<h3>Injury or Death</h3>
		
		<p>As devastating as the loss of a vehicle might be, trust us when we 
		tell you that it's really among the best case scenarios for those 
		involved in a crash. The losses could easily extend to life and limb!</p>
		
		<p>You'd recover quickly enough from a few scratches, of course. But the 
		forces that can be generated by objects of the mass and velocity of a 
		speeding of motor vehicle are tremendous. Those forces are enough to 
		easily break bones, tear flesh, and shred organs.</p>
		
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Mummy-Crutches.jpg" alt="Mummy on Crutches" />
		</div>
		
		<p>Now&hellip;imagine others are involved. Perhaps you had a passenger 
		in your vehicle; or maybe you struck a pedestrian or a vehicle 
		containing others. You might be responsible for injuring, perhaps 
		seriously and permanently, another person. Worse still, you might be 
		responsible for <em>killing</em> that person! You could be financially 
		liable for that person's medical bills and for their lost wages if they 
		were injured severely enough to miss work. But think for a moment of 
		the remorse you'd feel for taking another life. Perhaps it was a young 
		person, or a parent whose children will never see them again. You would 
		be responsible for these losses&mdash;and all because you failed to 
		show the proper care and respect for the powerful vehicle you were 
		operating.</p>
		
		<p>It can be grim to consider. But you'll greatly increase your odds 
		of avoiding such a fate if you simply drive responsibly!</p>
		
		<h3>Insurance Increase</h3>
		
		<p>As a driver, you're aware that insurance doesn't come cheap. A bad 
		driving record will further boost those rates. But&hellip;just how 
		much will a blip on your record cost you? Plenty! A study conducted 
		by an insurance industry clearinghouse found that drivers who had one 
		or more moving violations on their record could face skyrocketing 
		quotes on their automobile insurance.</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>One violation led to an average annual premium increase 
				of 18%.</li>
				<li>Two violations led to an average annual premium increase 
				of 34%.</li>
				<li>Three violations led to an average annual premium increase 
				of 53%.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>"The lesson is simple: drivers who speed, drink and drive, or engage 
		in other bad driving behaviors will pay through the nose if they want 
		to keep their car insurance," noted Chris Kissell, a managing editor. 
		"The best way to save money on car insurance is to drive responsibly 
		at all times."</p>

		<h3>Financial Impact and Legal/DMV Actions</h3>
		
		<p>Insurance companies aren't the only ones who are concerned about 
		bad driving behaviors. When you drive carelessly, you're likely to 
		have a run-in with a law enforcement officer at some point. If so, 
		you'll probably have to pay a fine. Should you find yourself in front 
		of a judge, you might have your vehicle or your driver license taken 
		away. You might be sentenced to community service or even jail time 
		if your actions presented an extreme threat to the safety of others.</p>
		
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Judge.jpg" alt="Judge" />
		</div>
		
		<p>Independently of the courts, the DMV may take action against a 
		driver's license. Driving is a privilege, after all, not a right. A 
		<em>right</em> is something that is due a person by their very nature, 
		and is irrevocable. A <em>privilege</em>, on the other hand, is an 
		opportunity that is granted subject to the fulfillment of certain 
		requirements and stipulations. Avoid the habit of thinking that the 
		State of California owes you a driver's license&mdash;the State extends 
		you the driving privilege only for as long as you prove to be a safe 
		and responsible driver!</p>
		
		<p>The State has several options when it comes to taking action against 
		your driving privilege:</p>
		
		<p><strong>Probation:</strong> As an alternative to suspension, drivers 
		can be given a "stern warning" for a relatively minor offense and 
		allowed to keep their license. Those who reoffend before the 
		probationary period is up will have their license suspended.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Suspension:</strong> Under suspension, a person's driving 
		privileges are "temporarily withdrawn"&mdash;either by a judge as 
		part of some criminal penalty, or by the DMV as a result of point 
		accumulation or because it has been determined that the person 
		presents a danger on the road. Drivers who have had their license 
		suspended because of a DMV administrative action may get their license 
		back at the end of the suspension period by applying to the DMV for 
		reinstatement and demonstrating proof of financial responsibility. If 
		the license was suspended due to a physical or mental condition, the 
		DMV may require the person to submit to any examination deemed 
		appropriate to demonstrate the ability to safely operate a motor 
		vehicle.</p>
		
		<p>Your license may be suspended for up to six months for:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>failure to stop at the scene of a collision in which you 
				were involved</li>
				<li>failure to stop at a railroad crossing</li>
				<li>evading a peace officer (if the driver's license is not 
				revoked for this violation)</li>
				<li>knowingly participating in a vehicular collision for the 
				purposes of insurance fraud</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>Note that you cannot escape suspension by simply ignoring traffic 
		citations. Should you fail to appear in court (FTA) for a traffic 
		citation, the court will notify the DMV and the FTA will appear on your 
		driving record. Likewise, failure to pay a fine (FTP) will cause the 
		court to notify the DMV and the FTP will appear on your record. Even 
		one FTA or FTP on your record can lead the DMV to suspend your license. 
		Ending the suspension will cost you a reissue fee and&mdash;oh, 
		yeah&mdash;you'll have to go to court anyway to get the issue resolved. 
		In short&hellip;take care of those traffic citations, because they won't 
		go away on their own!</p>
		
		<p><strong>Revocation:</strong> This means that a person's privilege to 
		operate a motor vehicle has been terminated, usually as the result of a 
		very serious offense that indicates a blatant disregard for the safety 
		of others. For instance, the DMV will revoke your license for a conviction 
		of failure to stop at the scene of an accident in which you were involved 
		that resulted in an injury or death to a person or of evading a peace 
		officer. Drivers who have had their license revoked may reapply for a new 
		license after the period of revocation expires (with all of the "fun" that 
		applying for a brand new license brings).</p>

		<h3>The Negligent Operator Treatment System</h3>
		
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Coach.jpg" alt="Coach" />
			<div class="caption">Sometimes, folks just need a <br />
			little coaching to drive better.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>One of the ways that the State of California manages its licensed 
		drivers is through the <em>Negligent Operator Treatment System 
		(NOTS)</em>. The idea behind NOTS is simple: Just as a small subset 
		of the population tends to commit crimes repeatedly, accounting for 
		a disproportionate amount of the overall crime rate, so are there
		operators who tend to repeatedly drive in a careless or unsafe manner. 
		These repeat offenders account for a disproportionate amount of 
		danger on the roadway. NOTS is an automated system that identifies as 
		negligent those motorists who are repeatedly cited by law enforcement 
		or involved in collisions. The underlying assumption is that motorists 
		who repeatedly drive in a negligent manner become accustomed to unsafe 
		driving techniques, ultimately becoming a menace as their repertoire 
		of bad habits grows.</p>
		
		<p>Keep in mind that NOTS isn't just a punitive program. 
		<em>Treatment</em> is a part of the title&mdash;and a part of the 
		scheme. The DMV seeks to use the program to improve the habits of 
		chronically negligent drivers. They counsel those whom the program 
		identifies, and monitor the rehabilitation of negligent drivers with 
		an assessment tool called a <em>Driver Improvement Analysis</em>.</p>
		
		<h4>Points on Your Record</h4>
		
		<p>The DMV maintains a record of every driver's traffic convictions and 
		collisions, with each incident remaining on the record for 36 months 
		(or longer, for a few very serious violations). Each infraction has a 
		point value attached to it, and it is a total of these points that is 
		monitored by NOTS.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Violations</strong></p>
		
		<p><strong>One point</strong> is assessed to a driving record for a 
		variety of "lesser" violations, such as:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>speeding</li>
				<li>running a red light/stop sign</li>
				<li>turning violations</li>
			</ul>
			
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Writing_Ticket.jpg" alt="Writing a Ticket" 
			style="padding-right:40px;" />
		</div>
		
		<p><strong>Two points</strong> are assessed to a record for more 
		serious violations, such as:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>reckless driving</li>
				<li>driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs</li>
				<li>hit-and-run driving</li>
				<li>operating a motor vehicle while your license is suspended 
				or revoked</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p><strong>Collisions</strong></p>
		
		<p>Any collision in which a driver is determined by law enforcement 
		personnel to be "at fault" will result in a <strong>one-point 
		assessment</strong> to the driver's record.</p>
		
		<h4>Point Accumulation</h4>
		
		<p>NOTS responds on a sliding scale, depending on a driver's point 
		count:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>When a driver accumulates two points within a 12-month 
				period, the person is sent a warning letter.</li>
				<li>When a driver accumulates three points within a 12-month 
				period, the person is sent a Notice of Intent to Suspend. 
				Assessment of another point will result in a suspension.</li>
				<li>When a driver accumulates four points within a 12-month 
				period, the driver's license is suspended for six months.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>Drivers will be considered "negligent"&mdash;and will have their 
		license suspended for six months&mdash;if their driving record exhibits 
		any of the following point totals (regardless of license class):</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>4 points in 12 months</li>
				<li>6 points in 24 months</li>
				<li>8 points in 36 months</li>
			</ul>
			
		<h3>Impact on Quality of Life</h3>

			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/New_Car.jpg" alt="New Car" />
			<div class="caption">You think of your fantasy car as the key <br />
			to the good life. But, with great power <br />
			comes great responsibility!</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>You probably think of that wallet-sized plastic wafer known as a 
		driver license as your ticket to freedom and independence. There's 
		nothing quite like driving your own vehicle and tailoring your 
		schedule to your own wants and needs. Life can be so much fuller when 
		you can slip behind the wheel and be whisked away to wherever you 
		want to be: to a friend's or relative's house, to the beach, to the 
		mountains, to the store, to museums, libraries, schools, 
		theaters&hellip;. The list of exotic locales is nearly endless, and 
		the possibilities exciting!</p>
		
		<p>As you might imagine, you're not the only one who has these dreams 
		and aspirations. All of the other drivers out there feel the same way. 
		It's easy to get caught up in the hype. But drivers must remember that 
		this fanciful lifestyle is the very thing that can be lost when a motor 
		vehicle is operated in a careless manner. As we discussed in detail 
		above, you could wind up losing your license or your vehicle, your 
		financial security, or the full functioning of your body. You might 
		even wind up losing your life. Or, you could wind up depriving someone 
		else of these things.</p>
		
		<p>In the end, this is why you need to take great care to always drive 
		responsibly!</p>

			They often happen because <br />
			drivers do careless things, like&hellip; <br />
			driving at an unsafe speed.</div>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Contributing Factors Can Cause Collisions</h3>
		
		<p>The fact of the matter is that very few collisions "just happen." 
		They most often follow from episodes of careless driving and involve 
		certain <em>contributing factors</em>. The actions that most commonly 
		culminate in a crash include:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>driving at an unsafe speed</li>
				<li>driving on the wrong side of the road</li>
				<li>turning improperly</li>
				<li>violating right-of-way rules</li>
				<li>failing to stop at stop sign/signal</li>
				<li>operating a vehicle while distracted</li>
				<li>operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of 
				alcohol or other drugs</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>This course discusses these bad driving behaviors in detail, and 
		provides some simple advice on how you can best avoid the dangers of 
		these actions. By taking a little care and driving more responsibly, 
		you can greatly decrease your odds of getting into a dangerous 
		collision.</p>

		<h3>DUI and Its Additional Impact</h3>
		
		<p>A significant contributing factor in collisions is the operation of 
		a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs 
		(DUI). It is, perhaps, the most careless thing that a driver could ever 
		do.</p>
		
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Alcoholism.jpg" alt="Alcoholism" />
		</div>
		
		<h4>Legal Consequences</h4>
		
		<p>If you are convicted of driving with an excessively high BAC, or 
		while under the influence of either alcohol or drugs or both (DUI), 
		you may be sentenced to serve up to six months in jail and to pay a 
		fine of between $390 and $1,000 (plus penalty assessments) for a first 
		conviction. In addition, your vehicle may be impounded and is subject 
		to storage fees. On a first conviction, the court will suspend your 
		driving privileges for six months. You will be required to demonstrate 
		financial responsibility and to complete a DUI program before the 
		driving privilege can be reinstated. The length of the treatment 
		program may vary.</p>
		
		<p>Generally, if you are over 21 and enroll in a DUI program, 
		demonstrate proof of insurance, and pay the restriction and reissue 
		fees, the DMV will issue you a restricted driver license. This allows 
		you to drive to and from work as well as on-the-job (unless you hold a 
		commercial license), and to and from a DUI program. However, if your 
		driving would be considered a public safety risk, the court may order 
		the DMV not to grant a restricted license. (Other actions against you 
		may also prohibit the issuance of a restricted license.)</p>
		
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Drunk_Drive_Arrest.jpg" alt="Drunk Drive Arrest" />
		</div>
		
		<p>DUI convictions remain on your driving record for ten years, and the 
		courts and/or DMV may impose more stringent penalties for subsequent 
		violations during that period.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Misdemeanor vs Felony Convictions</strong>
		
		<p><strong>Misdemeanor DUI Conviction.</strong> If you are stopped for 
		a DUI before you cause injury or death, you will most likely be charged 
		with a misdemeanor count of DUI. This is punishable by fines and/or jail 
		time and/or other sanctions.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Felony DUI Conviction.</strong> When injury or death results 
		from your DUI, the charge will be felony DUI. A DUI felony is treated as 
		harshly as any other felony. You can spend years in prison, depending on 
		the severity of the results of your actions. In recent years, drivers 
		have been convicted of second-degree murder for a felony DUI! You might 
		also be punished under California's "Three Strikes" Law, as well as face 
		a civil lawsuit.</p>

		<h4>Financial Impact</h4>
		
		<p>Having "one for the road" might cost you more than you think. Most 
		people are aware that drinking and driving is a dangerous choice that 
		can lead to property damage, injuries, and even death. But they often 
		fail to consider all of the financial consequences until it's too late. 
		The costs of a DUI are staggering, from court costs, fines, and 
		attorneys' fees, to treatment programs, probation, and higher insurance 
		premiums.</p>

		<p>Sure, you were thirsty that night. But is any beer really worth 
		<em>that</em> kind of money? Think of the other ways it could be 
		better spent!</p>
		
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> We haven't even considered any costs and 
		penalties that might be incurred in a civil trial which results from 
		death or injury you cause by operating a vehicle while impaired. If 
		the above totals are large, they could be just the tip of the iceberg!</p>
		
		<p>Finally, if you are convicted of DUI, you will have a criminal record, 
		and you will have to report the conviction on most employment and loan 
		applications. Employers and lenders may think twice about taking a 
		chance on you; and if you are convicted a second time, you can probably 
		forget about being considered at all.</p>
		
		<h4>Emotional Impact</h4>
		
		<p>After suffering through all of the penalties handed out for 
		conviction for DUI, you'd likely be feeling pretty bad about your 
		situation. That's probably intentional&mdash;because driving under 
		the influence of alcohol or other drugs is <em>so</em> dangerous, 
		the punishments are designed to be harsh and certain so you (and 
		others) will be discouraged from ever engaging in the activity.</p>
		
		<p>Imagine how down you might feel if you have been maimed or 
		handicapped as the result of an alcohol-related crash. Worse still, 
		imagine suffering a lifetime of guilt and anguish because you harmed or 
		killed someone else while driving under the influence&mdash;especially 
		when you consider how easy it could have been to avoid such an outcome. 
		Before you operate a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol or other 
		drugs, ask yourself if it's worth it.</p>
		
		<p>But enough about you. How might your DUI impact others?</p>
		
		<h4>Victims and Their Families</h4>
		
		<p>Imagine how <em>your</em> family might react to your DUI. They 
		could find themselves sharing in the inconveniences imposed on you 
		by the legal penalties handed out for your offense. They might also 
		experience a sense of shame over your actions&mdash;especially in those 
		cases where there was a catastrophic outcome. Or, imagine how your 
		loved ones might react if you were injured or killed in a crash that 
		resulted from your DUI. They might have to take care of you. At the 
		very least, the quality of your life with your family might be 
		diminished. Worse still, you might not be able to provide for them as 
		you did previously. Or you might not be there for them at all&hellip;.</p>

			your victims.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>Imagine how a victim of your DUI might feel. This person is an 
		innocent casualty of your irresponsible behavior. It might even be a 
		friend or relative whose life is changed forever in a tragic turn of 
		events. You'll likely feel no less sorry for a stranger who just 
		happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, of course. Still, 
		no matter your level of intimacy with the victim(s) of your DUI, no 
		matter how unintentional the results, you remain accountable for the 
		negative effects of your actions.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, imagine how your DUI might affect the family of a victim 
		of your DUI. They're likely to face the same challenges that your 
		family might: They could be forced to cope with diminished 
		capabilities&mdash;or the loss&mdash;of a loved one. Their lives are 
		likely to be forever changed for the worse. They have no one to blame 
		but you for their unfortunate position, and it was all the result of 
		a grossly irresponsible and easily avoidable act. You'll forgive them 
		if they seem a little hostile.</p>
		
		<h4>Societal Impact</h4>
		
		<p>Society, in general, also suffers from the repercussions of DUI. 
		The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes in the United States totals 
		well over $51 billion. Because the reduced reaction times of drivers 
		under the influence of alcohol prevent those operators from slowing 
		their vehicles or avoiding hazards as effectively as sober drivers, 
		emergency room and other medical costs are generally higher for 
		alcohol-related crashes. These generally more destructive crashes 
		also mean that time and productivity losses in the workplace can be 
		significantly higher.</p>

		<p>In the end, drinking (or taking other drugs) and driving is a 
		careless and irresponsible action that can have a variety of negative 
		consequences for everyone involved, for those close to them, and for 
		society. The best course of action, then, is to <em>NEVER</em> consume 
		alcohol or other drugs before you drive!</p>
