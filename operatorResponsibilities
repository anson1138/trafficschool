		<h2>Operator Responsibilities</h2>
		
		<p>The old joke says that the most important piece of safety equipment 
		on a motor vehicle is the nut behind the wheel. All joking aside, that 
		means <em>you</em>. And the point of the message should be clear: Each 
		driver is responsible to ensure that they operate their vehicles 
		safely.</p>
		
		<p>Drivers must be physically capable of safely operating a vehicle, 
		of course. Although the variety of assist systems and adaptive devices 
		available to today's drivers mean that <em>most</em> motorists can be 
		accommodated, there a few requirements to remain mindful of. Perhaps 
		more importantly, however, are the psychological and environmental 
		factors that can affect any driver's ability to safely operate a vehicle 
		at any time. It is every driver's responsibility to be aware of these 
		factors and to respond appropriately to them&mdmdash;even by abstaining 
		from operating a vehicle under extremely adverse conditions.</p>
		
		<p>Drivers are also expected to know the rules of the road and when 
		and how to apply them. Finally, drivers owe a certain amount of 
		consideration to those with whom they share the road, and are, in part, 
		responsible for their safety.</p>
		
		<h3>Knowing When Not to Drive</h3>
		
		<h4>Personal Concerns</h4>
		
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Blindfolded.jpg" alt="Blindfolded" />
		</div>
		
		<p><strong>Vision</strong></p>
		
		<p>Nearly all of the sensory input we need to safely operate a motor 
		vehicle comes from visual cues. If you cannot see clearly, you will 
		have difficulty detecting hazardous situations and judging distances. 
		And you need peripheral vision to detect vehicles coming up beside you 
		("out of the corner of your eye") as you focus on the road ahead.</p>
		
		<p>Unless you intend to restrict your driving to certain times of 
		day, you must also be able to see well under a variety of lighting 
		conditions. Many drivers who see clearly in the daytime may see poorly 
		at night. They may not be able to see well in dim lighting conditions, 
		or they may have trouble with the glare from the headlights of 
		approaching vehicles.</p>
		
		<p>In California, anyone who applies for an original or renewal driver 
		license must pass a DMV-administered visual acuity screening. You must 
		have corrected or uncorrected vision of:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>20/40 with both eyes tested together and</li>
				<li>20/40 in one eye and</li>
				<li>20/70, at least, in the other eye</li>
			</ul>
			
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Mad_Scientist.jpg" alt="Mad Scientist" />
			<div class="caption">If you needed corrective <br />
			lenses to pass the vision <br />
			exam, you must wear them <br />
			when driving!</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>If you cannot meet the vision screening standard, you will be 
		referred to a vision specialist. Upon your return to the DMV with a 
		completed and signed (by your eye doctor) Report of Vision Examination, 
		your vision will be retested. You will also have to take a driving test 
		to demonstrate that you can drive safely, even though your vision is 
		impaired. Passing the driving test establishes that you can compensate 
		for the visual deficiencies that you have. By law, however, you will be 
		refused a license if you do not have a minimum visual acuity in at least 
		one eye that is better than 20/200 (best corrected, without the use of 
		a bioptic telescopic lens or similar device).</p>
		
		<p>Drivers who needed corrective lenses in order to pass the vision 
		screening are required to wear those lenses whenever they operate a 
		motor vehicle. This restriction will be noted on their license.</p>
		
		<p>Everyone, but especially drivers, should get regular eye 
		examinations&mdash;at least once every year or two. If you need 
		corrective lenses, you can get the prescription updated (as needed) at 
		that time. And you may not realize that you've lost peripheral vision 
		or distance judgment unless you have your eyes checked by a healthcare 
		professional. A complete eye exam will also reveal any diseases of the 
		eye, many of which can be treated simply and effectively thanks to 
		advancements in medical science.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Fatigue/Drowsiness</strong></p>
		
		<p><em>Fatigue</em> is the decreased capacity to function normally 
		because of excessive stimulation or exertion, and usually manifests 
		itself as drowsiness or a general weariness. It can be caused by a lack 
		of sleep; physical overexertion; overeating (which reroutes blood from 
		your brain to your stomach and releases hormones that may make you 
		drowsy); driving down long, monotonous stretches of road; or 
		physiological overload caused by prolonged stress. Fatigue compromises 
		your ability to concentrate, slows your reaction time, and may affect 
		your ability to control the vehicle.</p>
		
		<div class="img_r">

			<div class="caption">Don't be like this fellow. <br />
			When you're too tired to <br />
			drive safely, reach for <br />
			a pillow, not the clutch.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>To avoid fatigue before starting out:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Get enough sleep on a regular basis.</li>
				<li>Monitor your physical condition before entering your vehicle. 
				If you feel extremely tired, do not drive.</li>
				<li>Avoid driving late at night. Most drivers are less alert at 
				night, especially after midnight.</li>
				<li>Do not take any drugs that can make you drowsy.</li>
				<li>Don't overeat, and attempt to space meals so that digestion 
				doesn't require so much from your body that it interferes with 
				the task of driving.</li>
				<li>Exercise can help you to build up endurance, but do not 
				exercise vigorously just prior to driving long distances.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>To deal with fatigue that occurs during a trip:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Split long drives into shorter segments, stopping and 
				resting between segments whether you feel tired or not.</li>
				<li>Move around during rest breaks to get your blood flowing.</li>
				<li>Force yourself to attend to the driving task by checking 
				mirrors, looking ahead, and keeping your eyes moving. This 
				will help you to maintain alertness.</li>
				<li>Try chewing gum or singing along with the radio.</li>
				<li>Roll down your window to get some fresh air.</li>
				<li>In extreme cases, pull over at a rest stop and take a nap.</li>
			</ul>

		<p><strong>Stress</strong></p>
		
		<p>Contrary to popular belief, stress is a necessary and useful part of 
		our lives, and we should welcome it&mdash;to a degree. Stress is a 
		physiological reaction to unusual physical and/or emotional stimuli. 
		The stress reaction often begins with a shot of adrenaline that raises 
		our heart rate and sharpens our perceptions, preparing us to respond 
		to the novel situation. While we tend to be less stressed by familiar 
		environments and routine activities, few people would want their lives 
		to be strictly routine all of the time.</p>
		
		<p>Stress becomes an unwanted factor during the driving activity when 
		it becomes acute to the point of distraction, however. Too much stress 
		can leave us "hyped-up," and interfere with our ability to properly 
		focus on the driving task. Alternately, stress can manifest itself as 
		extreme tiredness. This also interferes with drivers' ability to perceive 
		and appropriately process stimuli, and reduces the ability to react. As 
		well, too much stress can lead to irritability and overreaction to minor 
		inconveniences.</p>
		
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Stressed_Out.jpg" alt="Stressed Out" />
			<div class="caption">Stress and strong emotions <br />
			take your mind off of the <br />
			driving task and leave you <br />
			unprepared to drive. Deal <br />
			with these distractions <em>before</em> <br />
			you get in the vehicle.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>Monitor your stress level before entering the vehicle. If stress makes 
		it impossible for you to remain courteous and attentive to the driving 
		task, do not get behind the wheel until you can refocus.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Emotional Distress</strong></p>
		
		<p>It is not only "negative" emotions like anger and anxiety that lead 
		to unsafe decisions while driving. The term <em>emotional distress</em> 
		can apply equally to feelings of glee or jubilation, which can be just 
		as distracting to drivers and cause them to speed or drive recklessly. 
		When you've just heard that you're getting a big raise, for instance, 
		you are likely to be thinking about how you'll spend the money rather 
		than focusing on the driving conditions.</p>
		
		<p>It is essential to realize that feelings impact driving habits. 
		The key is to lessen the pressure of these feelings and reduce the 
		probability that the driver will create a dangerous driving situation. 
		If you find yourself emotionally agitated&mdash;in a positive <em>or</em> 
		a negative way&mdash;wait until the feelings subside before putting the 
		key in the ignition. And if you are suddenly overwhelmed by emotion 
		while driving, whether the emotion is the resurgence of some earlier 
		feelings or a new emotion created by driving conditions, you may have 
		to pull over and let the feeling pass. If you can refocus on the driving 
		task, this serves both to quell powerful emotions and to improve your 
		driving performance.</p>
		
		<p><strong>The Effects of Alcohol/Medication</strong></p>
		
		<p>Perhaps the most dangerous&mdash;and most irresponsible&mdash;thing 
		you could ever do as a motorist is to drive under the influence of 
		alcohol or other drugs! <strong>NEVER DRINK (OR USE OTHER DRUGS) AND 
		DRIVE!</strong></p>
		
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Effects_of_Alcohol.jpg" alt="Effects of Alcohol" />
		</div>
		
		<p><strong>Alcohol is a Drug.</strong> A toxin that can alter brain 
		chemistry, alcohol is a powerful drug that can produce short-term 
		behavioral changes and long-term physical addiction. Ultimately, the 
		physiological stress of cleansing the body of alcohol contributes to 
		the breakdown of many major anatomical systems.</p>
		
		<p>Pharmacologically, alcohol is a depressant, and it is the most widely 
		used&mdash;and abused&mdash;drug in the United States. When consumed, 
		alcohol acts quickly to slow the function of the central nervous system. 
		It suppresses brain activity and can act as a mild tranquilizer or a 
		general anesthetic, depending on the dose. In very low quantities, it 
		can appear to be a stimulant by curbing inhibitions. As alcohol 
		concentration increases, however, further suppression of nervous 
		functions produces the classic symptoms of impairment: slurred speech, 
		an unsteady gait, disrupted sensory perceptions, and the inability to 
		react in a timely manner. At high concentrations, alcohol produces 
		general anesthesia. An acutely impaired person can enter a coma-like 
		state and be difficult to rouse; in extreme cases, basic involuntary 
		bodily functions (e.g., breathing and heartbeat) can cease and death 
		can result.</p>
		
		<p><strong>"Know Your Limits."</strong> One of the artifacts of the old 
		way of thinking is that one can combine a "safe" level of drinking with 
		driving. This outdated concept is summarized in the admonition to "know 
		your limits." Today, traffic safety experts and addiction specialists 
		understand that there are no safe limits to drinking and driving. 
		Judgment is impaired by the first drink. Thus, even if a safe limit 
		existed, the drinker is the last person who could competently judge 
		whether he or she has had "too much." In short, <strong>NEVER DRINK (OR 
		USE OTHER DRUGS) AND DRIVE!</strong></p>
		
		<p><strong>Blood Alcohol Concentration.</strong> The amount of alcohol 
		in the body is calculated as the grams of alcohol in the bloodstream per 
		100 milliliters of blood, or the grams of alcohol in the breath per 210 
		liters of breath. This number is known as <em>blood alcohol concentration</em> 
		(often abbreviated as <em>BAC</em>, and sometimes referred to as <em>blood 
		alcohol level</em> or <em>blood alcohol content</em>). Blood alcohol 
		concentration is used to determine a driver's level of impairment. In 
		California (in fact, in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
		Puerto Rico), the law defines drivers as intoxicated if they test at 
		0.08% BAC or higher.</p>
		
		<p>BAC will vary depending on:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>the amount of alcohol consumed</li>
				<li>the time period over which the alcohol was consumed</li>
				<li>the body mass (weight) of the individual</li>
				<li>the individual's sensitivity to alcohol</li>
				<li>the presence in the body of other chemicals</li>
				<li>the type, amount, and recency of food consumed</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="caption">One "drink" = 1.5 oz. of 80 proof liquor, <br />
			12 oz. of 5% beer, or 5 oz. of 12% wine.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>The body naturally rids itself of alcohol at a rate of approximately 
		0.01% BAC every 40 minutes. This is a purely physiological process, and 
		an individual's rate of alcohol metabolism is relatively fixed; it 
		cannot be accelerated by consuming coffee, taking a cold shower, or 
		employing other folk remedies that supposedly help one to sober up more 
		quickly.</p>

		<p><strong>Effects of Alcohol on the Driving Task.</strong> By 
		inhibiting certain normal bodily functions, alcohol can significantly 
		hamper the ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.</p>
		
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Woman_Drunk.jpg" alt="Woman Drunk" />
		</div>
		
		<p>Alcohol can impact <strong>vision</strong> by hindering the reflex 
		action of the eyes. This is especially important at night (when most 
		drunk driving incidents occur) when a driver faces the headlights of 
		an oncoming vehicle. Normally, the pupils of the eyes constrict to 
		shut out excess light. Alcohol impairs this natural reaction, allowing 
		too much light to strike the retinas and temporarily blinding the driver. 
		Even after there are no more oncoming vehicles, the eyes take longer 
		to readjust to the darkness, causing the driver's vision to remain 
		maladapted.</p>
		
		<p>Under all lighting conditions, visual acuity deteriorates after only a 
		few drinks. Muscles in the eye lose their precision, leaving the impaired 
		driver with fuzzy, blurred&mdash;or even doubled&mdash;vision. A 
		diminished sense of peripheral vision can lead to "tunnel vision." Finally, 
		alcohol affects depth perception, causing impaired drivers to miscalculate 
		the distance of oncoming or cross traffic, and to misjudge the speed of 
		both their own vehicles and others'.</p>
		
		<p>Alcohol impacts <strong>judgment</strong>. Since drinking produces 
		euphoria and a sense of well-being, drivers under the influence tend to 
		take more risks on the roadway. Ironically, impaired drivers choose to 
		engage in more dangerous behavior even as alcohol robs them of the 
		higher cognitive functions necessary to anticipate hazards and 
		accurately gauge speed and stopping distance.</p>
		
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Googley.jpg" alt="Googley" />
			<div class="caption">Alcohol disrupts judgment and <br />
			reason, sensory perception, and <br />
			physical coordination. In clinical <br />
			terms, it makes you all "googley."</div>
		</div>
			
		<p>Alcohol slows our <strong>reaction times</strong>. As higher brain 
		functions&mdash;anticipation and judgment&mdash;deteriorate, muscular 
		reflexes slow. This lack of muscular coordination often manifests 
		itself as a stumbling and weaving gait. In a vehicle, it can manifest 
		itself as difficulty in steering and braking properly. Between the 
		slowness to recognize a hazard and the slowness to get a foot to the 
		brake, reaction time for an intoxicated driver is significantly 
		increased. At highway speeds, when a vehicle is moving almost 100 feet 
		per second, an impaired driver who loses just two seconds of reaction 
		time adds 200 feet to the vehicle's stopping distance!</p>
		
		<p>Finally, alcohol compromises <strong>simultaneous task 
		execution</strong>. Every driving maneuver requires the ability to 
		handle several tasks at once. The inability to coordinate the efforts 
		needed to safely operate a motor vehicle makes an impaired driver 
		extremely dangerous.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Other Drugs.</strong> Safety and public health officials 
		now recognize that the driving task can also be negatively impacted 
		by drugs other than alcohol. In turn, law enforcement officers have 
		become more sophisticated at detecting these drugs in drivers, and 
		penalties that were once meted out for alcohol have been extended to 
		other types of chemical intoxicants.</p>
		
		<p>Drugs fall into three categories: prescription drugs, 
		non-prescription drugs, and illegal drugs. All of these drugs can have 
		as profound an effect on the mental and physical skills necessary for 
		the safe operation of a motor vehicle as does alcohol. When you take 
		drugs and drive, you may be "driving under the influence" just as 
		certainly as if you were to consume alcohol and get behind the wheel.</p>
		
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Medications.jpg" alt="Medications" />
		</div>
		
		<p><strong>Prescription medications</strong> are drugs that are taken 
		under the supervision of a medical professional for specific symptoms. 
		The term <em>prescription medication</em> covers a wide variety of 
		pharmacologically active chemicals. Regardless of the specific effects, 
		you need to be careful when driving after having taken prescription 
		medications. Read the warning labels on your medicine bottles carefully. 
		They list a drug's effects and the activities that should be avoided 
		while taking the medication. Heed those warnings.</p>
		
		<p>Keep in mind that a prescription is legal only for the person for 
		whom it was written and in the dosage specified. Barring that, it's 
		just another illegal drug. Over the past several years, the abuse of 
		prescription drugs has become one of the biggest problems facing 
		public health officials. Ways of abusing include overmedicating with 
		prescription drugs and/or obtaining them with counterfeit 
		prescriptions. Be aware that taking prescriptions not written for you 
		is not only against the law, it is unsafe. Prescriptions are tailored 
		to the individual for whom they are written, making the dosage and/or 
		drug content potentially hazardous to someone taking it casually.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Non-prescription medications</strong> are drugs that are 
		sold over-the-counter at commercial retail outlets. Often, they are 
		merely less powerful variants of prescription medications. 
		Over-the-counter medications such as headache remedies, cold pills, 
		and cough syrups can make you just as drowsy as their prescribed 
		cousins, however. Non-prescription medications also come with warning 
		labels that should be read and obeyed.</p>

			<div class="caption">Marijuana is often considered <br />
			a depressant, but it has effects <br />
			which could place it in other <br />
			categories as well.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p><strong>Classes of Drugs</strong></p>
		
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Depressants:</strong> Earlier, we mentioned that 
				alcohol is a depressant. It is just one drug in an extensive 
				list of chemicals that slow the functioning of the central 
				nervous system. Depressants are the most widely prescribed, 
				used, and abused substances, and the category also includes 
				barbiturates, antihistamines, and tranquilizers. Depressants 
				induce drowsiness and diminish the normal activity of the 
				brain.</li>
				<li><strong>Narcotics:</strong> Narcotics are actually extremely 
				powerful depressants. They are highly addictive, and should only 
				be taken under a doctor's supervision. Heroin, morphine, and 
				codeine are all narcotics. These quick-acting drugs cause 
				drowsiness and loss of motor control. As they depress the 
				central nervous system, they affect vision and judgment. 
				Withdrawal from narcotics can cause visual and auditory 
				hallucinations, sweating and shaking, great physical discomfort, 
				and unconsciousness. Compromised higher cognitive functions 
				caused by the effects of narcotics lead to slowed reaction 
				time.</li>
				<li><strong>Stimulants:</strong> Stimulants have the opposite 
				effect from depressants: they speed up the central nervous 
				system. Stimulants include such things as diet aids, 
				amphetamines, and cocaine. The caffeine in coffee, tea, soft 
				drinks, and energy drinks is classified as a stimulant. By 
				stimulating the central nervous system these drugs can fragment 
				attention. Critical tasks, such as anticipation and preparation 
				for hazards, are compromised. A large enough dose of a stimulant 
				can cause the user to become "wired" or jittery, resulting in 
				erratic behavior.</li>
				<li><strong>Hallucinogens:</strong> Drugs classified as 
				hallucinogens can occur naturally or may be formulated in a 
				laboratory. Natural hallucinogens include peyote and mescaline, 
				while LSD and PCP are manufactured. These drugs act to alter the 
				user's reality by distorting sensory input or generating false 
				sensations. Users can see things that are not there, or see 
				distorted images of things that are there. They may hallucinate 
				sounds, touches, and other sensory data. Hallucinations 
				constitute a complete break from reality, and eliminate the 
				ability to anticipate, prepare, and react appropriately to the 
				driving environment.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p><strong>The Synergistic Effects of Multiple Drugs.</strong> 
		<em>Synergism</em> comes from the Greek word <em>synergos</em>, meaning 
		"to work together." It refers to the interaction of two or more 
		chemicals to produce a combined effect that is more profound than the 
		simple addition of the individual effects of those chemicals&mdash;a 
		sort of "one plus one is greater than two" effect. When <em>any</em> 
		two or more drugs are combined, they can create a level of 
		intoxication that is greater than either drug is capable of on its own. 
		Carefully read the warning labels on any medications you are taking, 
		and heed those warnings. Be wary of mixing any combination of alcohol, 
		drugs, and medication, whether you will be driving or not. The results 
		are often unexpected and can be incredibly harmful to the body.</p>
		
		<div align="center"><img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Synergism.jpg" alt="Syngergism" />
			<div class="caption" align="center">Use extreme caution when combining two or more drugs. <br />
			You never know what results you might conjure up!</div>
		</div>
		
		<p><strong>Implied Consent.</strong> Simply by signing an original 
		or renewal application for a driver license, persons give their 
		implied consent to submit to any tests deemed necessary to determine 
		the amount of intoxicating substances in their body upon the request 
		of a law enforcement officer who has lawfully arrested them for 
		driving under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs. <!--The 
		consent is deemed <em>implied</em> because the authorization has 
		already been given, and is not needed again at the time of arrest.--></p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>If arrested for DUI involving alcohol, the driver will 
				be administered a test of the blood or breath to determine 
				the amount of alcohol present in his or her body.</li>
				<li>If stopped for DUI involving drugs or a combination of 
				drugs and alcohol, the driver will be administered a test 
				of the blood to identify the type and amount of controlled 
				substances present in his or her body.</li>
				<li>A chemical test of the driver's urine may be 
				administered <em>only</em> if:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>both blood and breath tests are unavailable.</li>
					<li>the person is a hemophiliac.</li>
					<li>the person is taking anticoagulant medications.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		
		<p>Whether or not subsequently convicted of DUI, the driver's 
		license will be suspended for one year for refusing to submit to, 
		or for failing to complete, a lawfully requested chemical test. If 
		a refusing driver was convicted for DUI within the previous 10 years, 
		the person's vehicle may be impounded for 5 days (15 days for two or 
		more convictions within the previous 10 years).</p>
		<!--CVC 23612; CVC 13353, 13353.1-->
		
		<p><strong>Alternatives to Driving Impaired.</strong> The best&mdash;and 
		smartest&mdash;way to avoid a DUI is to never consume controlled 
		substances before getting behind the wheel of a motor vehicle. If you 
		insist on going out for a night on the town, consider these suggestions 
		to stay safe:</p>
		
		<div class="img_l">

			style="padding-right:40"/>
			<div class="caption">The best way to avoid DUI <br />
			is to never consume controlled <br />
			substances before driving.</div>
		</div>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Have a designated driver accompany you.<!-- The designated 
				driver program takes a positive approach to the very real 
				problem of drinking and driving&mdash;and it's highly effective. 
				The idea is that when two or more persons go to a place where 
				alcohol may be consumed, one person serves as the designated 
				sober driver. This driver must be over the age of 21, and must 
				possess a valid driver license. Many restaurants support this 
				program by offering free non-alcoholic drinks or other 
				incentives to the patron who identifies him/herself as the 
				designated driver (although, ultimately, management may refuse 
				service to anyone at any time). After completely abstaining from 
				the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicants, the designated 
				driver is then responsible to make sure that all other members 
				of the group arrive home safely. This allows several people to 
				drink socially without the fear of being cited for DUI&mdash;and 
				without injuring or killing someone.--></li>
				<li>Use alternative methods of transportation (e.g., cab, bus, 
				train). Do <em>not</em> ride a bicycle; it is considered a 
				vehicle, and you can be stopped for DUI. Besides, it's 
				dangerous!</li>
				<li>Call a friend for a ride home.</li>
				<li>Stay overnight at or near where you are consuming.</li>
				<li>Engage in activities that do not involve alcohol or drugs.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>Driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol is a grave&mdash;if 
		you'll excuse the pun&mdash;offense. When you drive under the influence, 
		you deliberately compromise your mental and physical faculties, 
		sometimes to the point of a total loss of control. And a loss of control 
		behind the wheel can lead to all sorts of other losses: property, life, 
		and health. You probably get the idea by now, but it always bears 
		repeating: <strong>NEVER DRINK (OR USE OTHER DRUGS) AND DRIVE!</strong></p>

		<p><strong>How to Avoid Impaired Drivers.</strong> Law enforcement 
		officers look for certain behaviors to help them identify impaired 
		drivers. You can take a cue from them and watch for:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>wide turns or straddling lanes</li>
				<li>driving with headlights off</li>
				<li>weaving</li>
				<li>tailgating</li>
				<li>erratic braking</li>
				<li>inconsistent use of turn signals</li>
				<li>abrupt or illegal turns</li>
				<li>slow responses</li>
				<li>driving excessively slow or fast</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>It is safer to be behind a drunk than in front of one. If you are 
		following a driver whom you suspect of being intoxicated, do not try to 
		pass. Slow down and try to put some distance between you and the other 
		vehicle. You may want to consider taking down the license plate number 
		and contacting the authorities if the driver's behavior is highly 
		erratic.</p>
		
		<p>If an impaired driver comes up behind you, try to find a safe "out." 
		Signal and make the first available right turn as quickly and safely as 
		possible. If no right turn is available, make the first available left 
		turn that doesn't require you to wait for a gap in oncoming traffic. 
		Once you can safely stop, wait for a minute or two before proceeding. 
		Never try to outrun an impaired driver. And do not just pull to the 
		side of the road and stop; impaired drivers have a tendency to follow 
		lights, so they may follow you off of the road and forget to stop.</p>
		
		<h4>Exterior Concerns</h4>
		
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Equip_Checklist.jpg" alt="Equipment Checklist" />
		</div>
		
		<p><strong>Vehicle Requirements</strong></p>
		
		<p>The State of California has established certain equipment 
		requirements for vehicles that are registered in the jurisdiction (as 
		outlined later in this course, in the section "The Vehicle"). While it 
		is mostly up to vehicle manufacturers to ensure that the vehicles they 
		sell are appropriately outfitted, it is the responsibility of drivers 
		to ensure that the vehicles are maintained to standards.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Licensing, Registration, and Insurance</strong></p>
		
		<p><strong>Driver Licensing.</strong> California residents who drive on 
		public highways or in public parking facilities must have a California 
		driver license (with exemptions for some military and government 
		personnel, as well as other stipulations). If you move to or within 
		California, you must apply for a license (or notify the DMV of your 
		change of address) within 10 days. It is a misdemeanor to drive in 
		California without a valid driver license. If you do, you can be cited, 
		your vehicle may be impounded, and you may have to appear in court.</p>
		
		<p>You will be denied a license if you:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>are not of the required age (at least 16 years for a 
				provisional license)</li>
				<li>have corrected vision that is worse than 20/200 (may not 
				use telescopic lenses)</li>
				<li>cannot pass the DMV's written or driving examinations</li>
				<li>do not surrender a license from another jurisdiction</li>
				<li>hold a license that has been suspended or revoked by any 
				jurisdiction</li>
			</ul>
			<!-- CVC 12805 -->
			
		<div align="center"><img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Denied.jpg" alt="Denied" />
			<div class="caption" align="center">Driving is a privilege, not a right. <br />
			Applicants may be denied a license <br />
			for a variety of reasons.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>In addition to your obligation to obey traffic laws while behind the 
		wheel, there are a few laws governing your use of the license itself. 
		It is unlawful to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>knowingly allow another person to use your driver license</li>
				<li>present a license issued to someone else as your own</li>
				<li>refuse to surrender a license that has been suspended, 
				revoked, or cancelled</li>
				<li>alter or reproduce a license in such a manner that it could 
				be mistaken for a valid license</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>As a condition of obtaining or renewing a driver's license, 
		applicants must sign a declaration acknowledging that they may be 
		charged with murder if a person is killed as a result of their driving 
		under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.</p>
		
		<p>Furthermore, drivers may operate only those vehicles they have been 
		licensed to drive. Different types of vehicles have different 
		performance characteristics, and the safe operation of various types 
		of vehicles therefore requires widely varying skill sets. The State 
		recognizes this fact and issues licenses in numerous classes.</p>

		<p>The State takes great pains to make traffic safety a priority. This 
		starts with minimum age requirements and the extensive testing of new 
		license applicants. Even so, teen drivers have conviction, collision, 
		and injury rates much higher than those of older drivers. This has led 
		to the implementation of a graduated driver license system, by which 
		drivers are slowly granted more privileges as they gain experience 
		behind the wheel. For complete information on the licensing of new 
		drivers and the restrictions placed on them, contact the DMV.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Vehicle Licensing and Registration.</strong> When you 
		purchase a new or used vehicle from a licensed California dealer, the 
		dealer collects a use tax and fees to register and title the vehicle. 
		The dealer submits these fees and documents to the DMV and supplies you 
		with a temporary registration. Within a few weeks after you purchase 
		your vehicle, you will receive in the mail a registration card, license 
		plates, stickers, and a Certificate of Title (if appropriate).</p>
		
		<p>If you obtain or purchase a vehicle from a private party, you must 
		register the change of ownership with the DMV within 10 days. You must 
		submit to the DMV:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>a properly completed and signed Certificate of Title</li>
				<li>smog certification provided by the seller (if required)</li>
				<li>use tax payment (if required)</li>
				<li>an Odometer Mileage Disclosure Statement, if applicable</li>
				<li>appropriate DMV fees</li>
			</ul>
			
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Paperwork.jpg" alt="Paperwork" />
			<div class="caption">If you sell or purchase a <br />
			vehicle in California, you'll <br />
			need to register it with <br />
			the DMV.</div>
		</div>
			
		<p>When you sell or transfer a vehicle, you must report the action to 
		the DMV within 5 days by completing a Notice of Transfer and Release of 
		Liability form.</p>
		
		<p>Vehicles registered in another state or foreign country must be 
		registered in California within 20 days after the owner becomes a 
		resident or gets a job (with exemptions for nonresident military 
		personnel and their spouses.) The paperwork needed to register an 
		out-of-state vehicle are:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>a properly completed and signed Application for Title or 
				Registration</li>
				<li>verification of the vehicle, completed by the DMV, law 
				enforcement agent, or an auto club employee</li>
				<li>an out-of-state title and/or last issued out-of-state 
				registration card, if the title is not submitted</li>
				<li>smog certification (1976 and newer motor vehicles only)</li>
				<li>weight certificate (for commercial vehicles only)</li>
				<li>use tax payment (if required)</li>
				<li>an Odometer Mileage Disclosure Statement, if applicable</li>
				<li>appropriate DMV fees</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have any questions about vehicle 
		registration, contact the Department of Motor Vehicles!</p>
		
		<p><strong>Liability Insurance.</strong> As a driver, you are required 
		to be financially responsible for your actions whenever you drive and 
		for all motor vehicles that you own. The options for demonstrating 
		financial responsibility include:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Self-Insurance:</strong> If you own 25 or more 
				vehicles with a combined total value of at least $575,000 and 
				have had your books audited for the last three years, you may 
				be able to claim <em>self-insured</em> status. Chances are 
				that this is not the case if you are an individual (unless 
				you're Jay Leno), but a  lot of vehicle dealerships use this 
				option.</li>
				<li><strong>Cash Deposit:</strong> If you have a spare 
				$35,000 laying around the house, you can meet your financial 
				responsibility requirement by depositing that money into a 
				bank account for the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). It 
				can be <em>any</em> bank account, so long as the funds are 
				held exclusively for the DMV.</li>
				<li><strong>Bond:</strong> Most trucking companies carry bonds 
				of a million dollars or more on their trucks and the loads 
				they haul. Individuals can also opt for a bond; but, despite 
				the relatively low requirement of the bond ($35,000), it's 
				probably not the most affordable option for individuals.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Insurance_Salesman.jpg" alt="Insurance Salesman" />
		</div>
		
		<p><em>Most</em> folks demonstrate financial responsibility by 
		purchasing an insurance policy. The minimum insurance coverage required 
		in California is referred to by the insurance industry as "15/30/5":</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li><strong>$15,000</strong> for a single death or injury</li>
				<li><strong>$30,000</strong> for death or injury to more than 
				one person in a given incident</li>
				<li><strong>$5,000</strong> for property damage</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>You must carry evidence of financial responsibility whenever you 
		drive, and you must show it to a peace officer upon request. Failure to 
		do so will get you a fine and may, at the discretion of the court, get 
		your vehicle impounded. Drivers who fail to provide evidence of 
		financial responsibility after being involved in a collision may further 
		face suspension of their driver license. The person's driving privileges 
		will not be reinstated for a period of one year and until the person 
		files proof of financial responsibility; the suspension will be 
		reinstated if the person fails to maintain proof of financial 
		responsibility for three years. (A person who pays a penalty fee of $250 
		and files proof of financial responsibility may be allowed to drive 
		during their suspension period for purposes of employment and to 
		transport a minor dependent to school, with the school superintendent's 
		written certification of need.)</p>
		
		<p>Drivers who provide false evidence of financial responsibility may be 
		found guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $750 
		and/or jail time not to exceed 30 days. They will also have their 
		driver's license suspended for one year from the date of conviction.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Conditions Beyond Driving Ability</strong></p>
		
		<p>Sometimes, environmental conditions can make driving 
		difficult&mdash;even downright dangerous! Driving in inclement weather, 
		if the conditions are severe enough, can present a problem to anyone. 
		But there are other times when conditions might be beyond the abilities 
		of a specific driver at a specific moment. For instance, a self-limiting 
		strategy commonly employed by older drivers is to take alternate routes 
		to avoid crowded thoroughfares, particularly during times of especially 
		heavy traffic. In the interest of safety, all drivers should have a 
		willingness to modify their travel plans&mdash;whatever the confounding 
		reason&mdash;until conditions are within the driver's ability to handle 
		them.</p>
		
		<h3>Communication</h3>
		
		<p>Communicating with other users of the roadway is key to defensive 
		driving. Few things more effectively prevent collisions than drivers 
		who are aware of others in the environment and forewarned of their 
		intentions. Fortunately, there are a variety of tools that drivers 
		can use to communicate their intentions to other users of the 
		roadway:</p>
		
		<div id="blinker_container" class="img_r" style="width: 288px;">
			<div class="caption" style="padding-left:15px">Signal lights are an extremely useful <br />
			means for communicating with others.<br /><br />
			
			To signal a right turn, position your <br />
			mouse pointer to the right of the vehicle. <br />
			To signal a left turn, position your <br />
			mouse pointer to the left of the vehicle. <br />
			To "apply the brakes," place your mouse <br />
			pointer toward the rear of the vehicle.
			<br /><br /></div>
			
			<script type="text/javascript">
			function swap(src){
				img = document.getElementById('blinker_car');
				img.src = 'http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Blinker_Animation/Blinker_' + src + '.gif';
			}
			</script>
			<a href="#" onclick="swap('Explode');"><img style="border:none;" id="blinker_car" 
			src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Blinker_Animation/Blinker_Off.gif" usemap="#blinker" /></a>
			<map name="blinker">
			  <area shape ="rect" coords ="0,0,144,180" onMouseOver="swap('Left');" onMouseOut="swap('Off');" alt="Left Blinker" />
			  <area shape ="rect" coords ="144,0,288,180" onMouseOver="swap('Right');" onMouseOut="swap('Off');" alt="Right Blinker" />
			  <area shape ="rect" coords ="0,180,288,361" onMouseOver="swap('Stop');" onMouseOut="swap('Off');" alt="Brake Lights" />
			</map>
		</div>
		
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Lights and Signals:</strong> The most obvious way 
				to employ these resources is to use them as intended. For 
				instance, you might use your turn signals to indicate a desire 
				to turn, or use your emergency flashers to warn others that you 
				are in trouble and/or immobilized. You might also attempt to 
				warn off a tailgater by tapping your brakes to flash your brake 
				lights (but resist the temptation to brake hard to "scare" the 
				following driver, as this may result in a rear-end collision!). 
				Or, you might flash your headlights to acknowledge another 
				vehicle's presence. Just remember that some of these measures 
				(e.g., flashing your lights) are ambiguous and should be used 
				sparingly. Sensitize yourself to what effectively communicates 
				information to other drivers, and what might be confusing.</li>
				<li><strong>Horn:</strong> As with any tool, your horn is most 
				effective when employed properly. Your horn should be used only 
				to give an audible warning when reasonably necessary to ensure 
				the safe operation of your vehicle. <!--(CVC 27001) -->You may 
				use it to warn other drivers and pedestrians who stray into 
				your line of travel, for instance. For such purposes, a few 
				short beeps are actually more effective than a long blast, 
				which tends to either blend into the background noise or scare 
				the living daylights out of the other party&mdash;neither of 
				which is particularly helpful.</li>
				<li><strong>Hand Signals:</strong> Drivers are required to use 
				hand-and-arm signals, from the left side of the vehicle, to 
				indicate turns and slowing/stopping when electric signals are 
				missing or malfunctioning. These signals might also be used to 
				enhance safety when electric signals may be difficult to see 
				(e.g., because of bright sunlight).</li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Left Turn:</strong> Left hand and arm extended 
					horizontally beyond the side of the vehicle.</li>
					<li><strong>Right Turn:</strong> Left hand and arm 
					extended upward beyond the side of the vehicle.</li>
					<li><strong>Slow or Stop:</strong> Left hand and arm 
					extended downward beyond the side of the vehicle.</li>
				</ul>
				<!--CVC 22110 - 22111-->
				<li><strong>Eye Contact:</strong> Use eye contact to acknowledge 
				the presence of other users of the roadway and to make sure that 
				the other person has seen you.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Communication is most effective when it 
		is based on courtesy. Always be polite when you communicate with other 
		drivers!</p>
		
		<h3>Courtesy</h3>
		
		<p>A misconception commonly shared by drivers&mdash;both new motorists 
		and those who have become habituated to driving&mdash;is that they 
		are alone when they are in their vehicles. Individual drivers sit 
		comfortably behind metal and glass in climate controlled vehicles 
		with the latest high-tech entertainment systems. Under such conditions, 
		it's easy to feel isolated&hellip;in your own little world. Such a 
		feeling is at the heart of a lot of bad driving behaviors. It is a 
		worldview that sees other users of the roadway as an intrusion. But the 
		fact of the matter is that you share the road with other drivers, the 
		operators of all sorts of vehicles, and pedestrians. In short, driving 
		is a <em>social</em> activity.</p>
		
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Man_wFlower.jpg" alt="Man with Flower" />
			<div class="caption">Always remain courteous, <br />
			thoughtful, and kind to others <br />
			while you're driving!</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>You wouldn't scream hysterically and make offensive gestures at a 
		co-worker who came around a blind corner and nearly ran into you, would 
		you? You wouldn't go to a restaurant and run full speed through the 
		place, pushing and shoving, trying to find a table, would you? For 
		the sake of your co-workers and fellow diners, we certainly hope you 
		wouldn't! In these sorts of situations, you're likely to be polite 
		and courteous with everyone you encounter. Yet, the rude behaviors 
		described above are exactly the type of actions that many drivers 
		engage in when they get behind the wheel. Because of the social nature 
		of the driving environment, however, drivers should be as courteous 
		while driving as they are in other social contexts&mdash;like the 
		workplace, a restaurant, or a party.</p>
		
		<p>Courtesy is an attitude of cooperation and politeness toward other 
		users of the roadway. The first&mdash;and most important&mdash;thing 
		that courtesy does is to stop a difficult situation from turning into 
		an angry confrontation. Such a scene is bad for everyone. And, in the 
		service of self-interest, courtesy can improve your situation by 
		helping to sort out the problem more quickly. If traffic is slowed 
		by drivers attempting to merge into your lane, for instance, allowing 
		another driver to merge smoothly and easily into the space in front 
		of you will ultimately get things moving more efficiently. Being 
		courteous, it turns out, is always a win-win proposition!</p>
		
		<h3>Knowing and Applying the Rules of the Road</h3>
		
		<p>No one expects drivers to know every section of the California 
		Vehicle Code by heart. There are portions detailing all sorts of 
		vehicle-related regulations, many of which are not pertinent to the 
		everyday operation of a motor vehicle. All drivers <em>are</em> 
		responsible, however, for knowing and correctly applying the basic 
		rules of the road that will allow safe interaction with others on 
		a daily basis. For the most part, everyday driving regulations are 
		basic and make sense, and drivers should always obey the literal 
		interpretation of those laws. Perhaps some of these regulations 
		have slipped your mind, but hopefully this course will help to 
		refresh your memory.</p>
		
		<h3>Identifying and Responding to Hazards</h3>
		
		<p>Drivers are in control of heavy machinery. As such, they are 
		responsible for identifying hazards in the roadway and responding 
		appropriately. We'll discuss some specific techniques later in this 
		course. But defensive drivers, who are adept at identifying and 
		responding to hazards, generally look ahead in traffic, take in the 
		entire scene, and anticipate where problems might occur. By doing so, 
		they can formulate tentative response strategies and be in a position 
		to easily implement those plans should the need arise. In this way, 
		they can help to keep everyone in the driving environment safe.</p>
		
		<h3>Young Passengers</h3>
		
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Big_Baby.jpg" alt="Big Baby" />
			<div class="caption">Drivers need to watch out <br />
			for children...and those who <br />
			act like them.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>Children in general, but especially those at very young ages, may 
		lack the experience or intellectual capacity to appreciate the sheer 
		power that automobiles possess. They don't take care, so <em>you</em> 
		must! Drivers are responsible for protecting young children from the 
		dangers that motor vehicles can present.</p>
		
		<h4>Check Around the Vehicle Before Entering</h4>
		
		<p>Drivers should check around the vehicle before climbing behind 
		the wheel. Children often play around vehicles, and adults may not be 
		aware of their presence. It's especially difficult when children are 
		on the ground or under the vehicle&mdash;exactly those areas where 
		they will remain undetected without some effort by the driver. To 
		avoid needless tragedy, check around the vehicle to ensure that all 
		is clear before you start out.</p>
		
		<h4>Unattended Children</h4>
		
		<p>Children, like <em>all</em> passengers, should always be properly 
		restrained when traveling in a motor vehicle. This is likely to save 
		them in a crash, of course, but it can have other benefits as well. 
		Curious, probing hands could release the brake or shift the 
		transmission into neutral when a child is left alone in a vehicle. 
		Children who are properly restrained, however, will not have access to 
		vehicle controls, and will be unable to cause unintentional harm.</p>
		
		<p>Children should <em>never</em> be left in a vehicle on a hot 
		day&mdash;whether accidentally, or consciously and negligently while 
		their parents run errands. While anyone can experience a memory lapse 
		and forget a child (it's the most common reason children are left 
		behind), that little slip could be deadly. Vehicles heat up quickly 
		on a hot day, and a child might die of hyperthermia in just minutes! 
		Meanwhile, those who knowingly leave their children alone are inviting 
		tragedy.</p>

		<p>These tips will help you to avoid a hot-vehicle mishap:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Place your cell phone, purse/briefcase, etc., on the floor 
				of the vehicle's rear seating area. When you retrieve them at 
				the end of your trip, you'll notice your child as well.</li>
				<li>Seat the younger (or quieter) child behind the front 
				passenger seat, where he or she is most likely to catch your 
				eye.</li>
				<li>Keep a teddy bear or other stuffed animal in the car seat 
				when it's empty. When you put your child in the seat, move the 
				toy to the front passenger seat as a reminder.</li>
				<li>Make a habit of always opening the back door of your 
				vehicle after you park to make sure there's no child back 
				there.</li>
				<li>Ask your child's babysitter or day care provider to 
				always phone you promptly if your child isn't dropped off as 
				scheduled.</li>
			</ul>

		</div>
		
		<p>"Kaitlyn's Law" (CVC &sect;15620) prohibits parents or guardians 
		from leaving a child 6 years old or younger inside a vehicle, without 
		the supervision of a person 12 years old or older, while the vehicle's 
		engine is running or while the vehicle's keys are in the ignition, or 
		when conditions inside the vehicle might present a significant risk to 
		the child's health or safety.</p>
		
		<h4>Smoking in the Vehicle</h4>
		
		<p>Second-hand smoke can be dangerous, especially to the developing 
		lungs of children. It is against the law for a person to have in their 
		immediate possession a lighted pipe, cigar, or cigarette containing 
		tobacco or any other plant while in a motor vehicle where a minor is 
		present. An infraction is a secondary enforcement, and is punishable 
		by a fine.</p>

		<h3>Poor Driving Conditions</h3>
		
		<p>When the weather gets nasty the roadway becomes a different and 
		more dangerous place. Driving conditions change constantly, and the 
		defensive driver is responsible to change with them. It helps to 
		check local weather conditions before setting out: call the state 
		patrol hotline, monitor local radio stations, or check Internet sites. 
		These days you can get real-time weather and road conditions for just 
		about anywhere. Do not drive into hazardous weather conditions when 
		you can avoid them; start your trip earlier or later.</p>
		
		<p>Remember also that posted speed limits are determined by traffic 
		engineers based on ideal conditions. Since bad weather creates 
		conditions that are less than ideal, you'll need to slow down and 
		adapt your driving habits to stay safe.</p>
		
		<h4>Fog</h4>
		
		<p>The air all around us contains water vapor. When the ambient 
		temperature drops below a certain level, the water vapor condenses 
		into droplets so tiny that they are light enough to remain suspended in 
		the air. These suspended droplets of water accumulate, and eventually 
		become a cloud that drifts along at ground level. It is no different 
		than a cloud in the sky; but when this cloud is at ground level, it is 
		known as <em>fog</em>.</p>
		
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Foggy.jpg" alt="Foggy" />
		</div>
		
		<p>Fog is moisture, which is a natural reflector of light. Fog makes 
		it difficult to see because it does not allow the clean transmission 
		of the information carried by light to our eyes. In other words, you 
		can't see through it. It's also hazardous because it can reflect the 
		light of your headlights and create a visual barrier all around your 
		vehicle. The diminished ability to rely on visual references can lead 
		to disorientation; you can feel as if you are floating weightless in 
		space. When driving in fog, anticipate that you will have problems 
		seeing at all distances, and expect that others will have difficulty 
		seeing you. Worse still, fog can condense on road surfaces, making 
		them damp and slick. This can make it dangerous to maneuver around 
		those hazards that fog obscures until the last minute.</p>
		
		<p>When driving in fog, remember these tips:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Activate your headlights on the <em>low beam</em> setting 
				when you drive in fog. High beam headlights can reflect off of 
				the tiny water droplets and shine back into your eyes, turning 
				the fog into a solid white shroud. Better still, use fog 
				lights&mdash;in conjunction with your low beam 
				headlights&mdash;if your vehicle is equipped with them.</li>
				<li>Control your speed. When you enter a fog bank, slow down 
				enough so that you will be able to bring your vehicle to a 
				stop within the distance you are able to see. You can work 
				your way back up as conditions allow. Keep plenty of space 
				between your vehicle and others to avoid hazards.</li>
				<li>Keep your defroster and windshield wipers in good working 
				order. You'll need them to clear your windows when moisture 
				condenses on the glass.</li>
				<li>Listen for traffic that you cannot see.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>Avoid passing other vehicles in the fog. Since visibility is limited, 
		you can never be certain that it's safe. Watch carefully for other 
		vehicles stopped on the roadside. If the fog becomes so thick that you 
		can barely see, pull <em>completely</em> off the road until the fog 
		clears enough to allow you to see again. Turn off your lights and keep 
		your foot off of the brake pedal so another driver doesn't see your 
		taillights, think you are moving, and drive into the back of your 
		vehicle.</p>
		
		<h4>Rain</h4>
		
		<p>It is not uncommon for motorists to miscalculate their traction needs 
		and other considerations on wet surfaces. Rain compromises your stopping 
		power and steering; and, like fog, it cuts visibility. The situation can 
		get even worse if strong winds are pushing your vehicle around. Luckily, 
		a few simple tips can keep you safe and on-course in the dampest of 
		conditions.</p>
		
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Wiper_Blade.jpg" alt="Wiper Blade" />
		</div>
		
		<p><strong>Visibility.</strong> Windshield wipers clear rain spattered 
		windows so you can see where you're going&mdash;but only if they're in 
		good condition. Wipe the blades off every couple of weeks with a rag 
		dipped in windshield-washer fluid to remove dirt and oxidized rubber. 
		Wiper blades should be replaced whenever they fail to cleanly sweep 
		water from the windshield, and will rarely be effective after more than 
		a year or so. Activating your defroster can help to remove moisture from 
		the <em>inside</em> of the windshield.</p>
		
		<p>Making sure that your windshield, lights, and mirrors are clean 
		helps you to maintain good visibility as well. You may be tempted to 
		allow rain to wash them clean. If the rain is heavy enough, it will 
		do the job&hellip;eventually. If the rain is light, or in the first 
		few minutes after it begins to rain, however, the rainwater can mix 
		with the residue on your windshield to create a gunky, smeary mess.</p>
		
		<p>You can also aid your ability to see and be seen by turning on your 
		headlights. The law requires drivers to activate their lights whenever 
		weather conditions reduce visibility to below 1,000 feet. Remember to 
		use your <em>low beam</em> headlights in the rain. Like fog, rain will 
		reflect high beam headlights back into your eyes.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Traction.</strong> Traction is always compromised in the 
		rain, but the worst time is during the first thirty minutes of rain 
		after a long drought. During the dry spell, oil and dirt build up on 
		the roadway. Rain loosens these substances and mixes with them to 
		form a slick mess on the road surface. Until this mess is washed to 
		the side of the road, it can be very slippery.</p>
		
		<p>When weather makes the road slippery, keep your pace down to a safe 
		speed. Even under the best of rainy conditions, stopping distances 
		will increase thanks to the loss of traction. Allow yourself two or 
		three times the normal stopping distance by decreasing your speed and 
		enlarging the space around your vehicle. Cutting your speed will also 
		help you to avoid <em>hydroplaning</em> (a dangerous phenomenon in 
		which your tires "ski" on a thin film of water, causing you to lose 
		control).</p>
		
		<p><strong>Submerged Dangers.</strong> Try to avoid driving through 
		water that has collected in potholes and other depressions in the 
		roadway. You can never be sure how deep the depression is, or what 
		lurks beneath its surface. You can break an axle by driving into a 
		vicious pothole, or completely disable your vehicle by going through 
		unexpectedly deep water.</p>
		
		<p>If you absolutely <em>must</em> drive through deep and/or moving 
		water, proceed very cautiously. You might be surprised by the 
		tremendous force possessed by rushing water. Evenly distributing 
		cargo weight can help you to maintain control over the vehicle, and 
		shifting into a lower gear helps to ensure that the vehicle has the 
		driving power to get through the water. After emerging from the water, 
		be sure to test your brakes to make sure they will stop the vehicle. 
		You can dry wet brakes by applying light pressure to the brake pedal 
		("riding the brake") for several seconds as you continue to drive.</p>

		<h4>Snow and Ice</h4>
		
		<p>Snowy conditions reduce your ability to see and make it difficult 
		for others to see you. Remove snow and ice from your windows and lights 
		before departing, and make sure your windshield wipers (including the 
		washer fluid) and defroster are well maintained. Kick snow from your 
		footwear so your foot doesn't slip off of the pedals while you're 
		driving. Activate your <em>low beam</em> headlights.</p>
		
		<p>If you venture out during or shortly after a snowstorm, you may come 
		across snow removal equipment. Snowplows are ultimately your friends, 
		but they can be dangerous to encounter. Give plows and sanding trucks 
		a wide berth, especially when they are working and have their flashing 
		warning lights on. Keep clear of the plume of plowed snow, as it can 
		create "whiteout" conditions that leave a driver blind. Finally, don't 
		assume that plowed roads will afford good traction.</p>
		
		<p>Carry a winter survival kit in your vehicle that includes warm 

		clothing/blankets, a shovel, a flashlight, matches and candles, and 
		high-energy foods. If your vehicle becomes stranded in a snowstorm, 
		<em>stay with the vehicle</em>! Most deaths occur when motorists 
		wander away from their vehicle and get lost. Run the vehicle and 
		heater for only short periods as needed. When doing so, crack the 
		windows and do your best to make sure that the tailpipe is clear of 
		obstructions in order to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
		
		<div class="img_l">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Tire_Chains.jpg" alt="Tire Chains" />
			<div class="caption">Use tire chains as necessary to enhance <br />
			traction in snowy weather.</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>Packed snow and/or ice create slippery road surfaces. You can put 
		snow tires or tire chains on your vehicle to increase traction. Even 
		so, you should create more space between your vehicle and others in 
		these conditions. Accelerate, steer, and brake gently. Above all, 
		slow down!</p>
		
		<p><strong>Ice.</strong> Snow tends to collect and remain in sheltered 
		and shaded areas, where it can freeze and refreeze. Also, watch for ice 
		around bridges (where water tends to freeze more readily than on other 
		road surfaces), ramps, and tunnels. Often, the biggest problem with ice 
		is knowing that it's there. Drivers may assume that a road that looks 
		slick is merely covered with water and not ice. A defensive driver 
		knows that it really doesn't matter, as both conditions are 
		slippery&mdash;and hazardous. Play it safe: slow down, and brake and 
		steer smoothly and gradually.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Starting from a Stop when Traction is Poor.</strong> 
		Traction is the key to getting your vehicle rolling, and there are 
		several ways to improve traction. The obvious one is to have tires 
		with sufficient tread. You can increase traction by adding weight 
		(sandbags or concrete blocks, for instance) over the drive wheels. 
		Throwing sand or another friction enhancing material under the drive 
		wheels can also help. Finally, try starting in a higher gear to reduce 
		the amount of torque being delivered to the drive wheels. Accelerate 
		smoothly and gradually.</p>

			<div class="caption">This sort of rocking out <br />
			might be fun, but it's not <br />
			going to help your vehicle <br />
			escape a rut!</div>
		</div>
		
		<p><strong>Rocking Out.</strong> If you're stuck in a 
		rut&mdash;literally, not psychologically&mdash;there is a technique to 
		help you get out. It entails rocking your vehicle back and forth, often 
		with the help of friends outside of the vehicle, in order to build up 
		enough momentum to get out.</p>
		
		<p>If help is available, position your assistants at either end of the 
		vehicle. They can push the vehicle as you gently accelerate. As your 
		forward progress is about to stop, release the accelerator and allow 
		the vehicle to fall back into the rut. At the lowest point, accelerate 
		gently in reverse; allow the vehicle to fall back into the rut as your 
		rearward progress is about to stop. Repeat these steps until adequate 
		momentum is built up and you can drive out of the snow or mud.</p>
		
		<h3>Rights and Duties</h3>
		
		<p>Driving is a social activity, and all users of the roadway have a 
		responsibility to keep each other safe. Therefore, each group of users 
		has certain rights and duties with regard to others.</p>
		
		<h4>Bicycle Safety</h4>
		
		<p>Bicycles are subject to the same rules of the road as motor vehicles. 
		They have all of the rights of motor vehicle operators, as well as all 
		of the obligations. Bicycles may travel in the same lanes as motor 
		vehicles so long as they do not impede the flow of traffic, however 
		cyclists should confine themselves to bicycle lanes or the right edge 
		of the road (except when preparing for a left turn) if they cannot keep 
		up with traffic.</p>
		
		<p>Drivers may make use of designated bicycle lanes when turning right. 
		Motorists may not enter a bike lane more than 200 feet before their 
		intended turn, however, and they must yield the right-of-way to 
		cyclists who are already in the lane.</p>
		
		<div class="img_r">
			<img src="http://virginia.netwood.net/~california/images/chapters_tsc/Bicyclist.jpg" alt="Bicyclist" />
		</div>
		
		<p>Always slow down as you approach a cyclist, and allow plenty of 
		room when passing&mdash;<em>at least</em> three feet between your 
		vehicle and the overtaken bicycle or its operator. When a three-foot 
		space cushion is not possible because of traffic or roadway conditions, 
		drivers are to slow to a reasonable and prudent speed and pass only 
		when doing so would not endanger the safety of the cyclist.</p>
		<!-- CVC 21760 -->
		
		<p>Be courteous and patient&mdash;especially with younger riders who 
		may not know or obey traffic rules. The most common motorist-caused 
		collisions between a motor vehicle and a bicycle occur when a driver 
		fails to yield to a cyclist when turning or after stopping at a stop 
		sign. This is usually because drivers overlook bicycles when they scan 
		the driving environment, or because they misjudge a cyclist's speed. 
		Always signal and check your mirrors and blind spot when changing 
		directions, but especially when turning right; yield the right-of-way 
		to cyclists as necessary.</p>
		
		<p>Under California law, a bicycle ridden at night must be equipped 
		with a white light that shines to the front of the bike and is visible 
		from at least 300 feet to the front and the sides. A cyclist is to 
		have on each pedal/shoe/ankle a white or yellow reflector that is 
		visible from the front and rear for at least 200 feet. Except for 
		bicycles with reflectorized tires, there must also be a white or 
		yellow reflector mounted front of center on each side of the bike, 
		and a red reflector mounted rear of center on each side of the bike. 
		Finally, bicycles are required to have a red reflector, or a solid 
		or flashing red light with a built-in reflector, that is visible 
		from a distance of 500 feet to the rear when illuminated by high 
		beam headlamps.</p>
		
		<p>Operators of bicycles ridden on a highway are required to ride 
		upon a permanent, regular seat, unless the bicycle was designed by the 
		manufacturer to be ridden without. All bicycle passengers must ride on 
		a permanent, regular seat; and passengers 4 years of age or less, or 
		who weigh 40 pounds or less, must be in a bicycle child safety seat. 
		Bicyclists under the age of 18 are required to wear an approved safety 
		helmet. Helmets and other safety equipment, such as shoes, gloves, 
		reflective clothing, and elbow- and knee pads are always highly 
		encouraged. It is unlawful for any person to ride a bicycle upon a 
		highway while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or other 
		drug.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Electric Bicycles</strong></p>
		
		<p>An <em>electric bicycle</em> (e-bike) is defined as a bicycle with 
		fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts. 
		Electric bicycles are classified based on their maximum motor speed and 
		level of electric assist:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Class 1 e-bikes</strong> are bicycles equipped with 
				a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, 
				and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 
				the speed of 20 mph. An approved bike helmet is required for 
				operators under the age of 18.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 2 e-bikes</strong> are bicycles equipped with 
				a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle, and 
				that is not capable of providing assistance when the bicycle 
				reaches the speed of 20 mph. An approved bike helmet is required 
				for operators under the age of 18.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 3 e-bikes</strong> are bicycles equipped with 
				a speedometer and with a motor that provides assistance only when 
				the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when 
				the bicycle reaches the speed of 28 mph. Operators must be at 
				least 16 years of age and are required to wear an approved bike 
				helmet.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<div class="img_l">

		</div>
		
		<p>Electric bicycles may not be tampered with or modified so as to 
		change their speed capability unless the classification label is also 
		changed.</p>
		<!-- CVC 312.5; 21213; 24016 (d) -->
		
		<p>Class 1 and 2 e-bikes may use bike paths or trails, unless specifically 
		prohibited; class 3 e-bikes may not use bike paths or trails unless 
		expressly authorized by local governments. Operators of e-bikes are not 
		required to have or maintain a driver license, vehicle registration, 
		license plates, or financial responsibility; however, e-bikes must follow 
		the same regulations governing standard bicycles, including traffic laws, 
		equipment requirements, and biking-under-the-influence laws.</p>
		<!-- CVC 21207.5; 24016 -->
		
		<p><strong>Electric Skateboards</strong></p>
		
		<p>An <em>electrically motorized board</em> (electric skateboard) is 
		any wheeled device that has a floorboard designed to be stood upon when 
		riding that is not greater than 60 inches deep and 18 inches wide, is 
		designed to transport only one person, and has an electric propulsion 
		system averaging less than 1,000 watts that is capable of propelling 
		the device on a paved level surface at no more than 20 mph. (The device 
		may be designed to also be powered by human propulsion.)</p>
		<!-- CVC 313.5 -->
		
		<p>Electric skateboards may be operated only by a person who is at 
		least 16 years of age and they may not be operated on a highway, 
		bikeway, public bike path, sidewalk, or trail, unless the person is 
		wearing an approved bicycle helmet. An electric skateboard operated on 
		a highway during darkness must have (or the operator must be wearing) 
		equipment to enhance visibility: a lamp emitting white light that is 
		visible from a distance of 300 feet to the front, a red reflector or 
		reflectorized material visible from a distance of 500 feet to the rear 
		when directly in front of the upper beams of the headlamps of a motor 
		vehicle, and a white or yellow reflector or reflectorized material 
		visible from a distance of 200 feet to the sides.</p>
		<!-- CVC 21291 - 21293 -->
		
		<p>Electrically motorized boards may only be used on a highway with a 
		speed limit of 35 mph, unless the board is operated entirely within a 
		Class II (striped bike lane) or Class IV (physically separated lane) 
		bikeway. Speeds on highways, bikeways, public bike paths, sidewalks, 
		and trails are restricted to a maximum of 15 mph; nor may a person 
		operate a motorized board at a speed greater than is reasonable or 
		prudent for existing conditions or at a speed that endangers the safety 
		of any person or property. Local authorities may enact further 
		regulations restricting use. It is also illegal to operate an 
		electrically motorized board on a highway while under the influence 
		of alcohol or other drugs; a conviction for violating this law is 
		punishable by a fine of up $250.</p>

		<h4>Motorcycle Safety</h4>
		
		<p>Like bicycles, motorcycles are often overlooked by drivers. Their 
		smaller size makes them hard to see in the first place, and it makes 
		it difficult to accurately judge their distance and speed. Quick 
		acceleration and the need to frequently adjust lane position also 
		make motorcycles challenging to track. But because most 
		automobile-motorcycle crashes are caused by a motorist's failure 
		to detect a motorcycle in traffic, it's easy to see why greater 
		vigilance is vital.</p>
		
		<p>Drivers must actively look for motorcycles. Check your mirrors 
		frequently, and don't allow yourself to be surprised by a motorcycle 
		driving between lanes of slow or stopped traffic ("splitting lanes"). 
		Be sure to check your blind spot when changing lanes or turning, and 
		watch for oncoming motorcycles when completing a left turn at 
		intersections. Increase your space cushion around motorcycles, and 
		never pass or drive alongside a motorcycle in the same lane. Take 
		special care to never tailgate a motorcyclist, as motorcycles have 
		much shorter stopping distances than passenger vehicles. Furthermore, 
		you'll want to have time to stop in the event the biker falls.</p>
		
		<p>For their part, motorcyclists may share a lane with one another; 
		they are strongly discouraged from riding more than two abreast, 
		however, as doing so would limit the ability of the center rider(s) 
		to maneuver in an emergency situation. Motorcycle operators must be 
		able to reach the ground with their feet, and handlebar grips may not 
		be positioned more than six inches above the operator's shoulders, when 
		the operator is sitting astride the seat. Motorcycle passengers must 
		ride on a securely fastened seat with footrests, or in a sidecar 
		designed to carry a passenger. The law also requires everyone riding 
		on a motorcycle to wear a properly fitted, approved safety helmet, but 
		smart bikers don't stop there. Goggles or face shields provide added 
		protection. Leather jackets, pants, gloves, and boots keep them warm 
		and dry, and can help to prevent serious injury in the event of a 
		collision or fall. Bright-colored clothing is better than darker 
		colors: fluorescent clothing is best for daytime riding, while 
		reflective gear should be worn at night.</p>

		<p>The law requires motorcycles to have at least one and not more than two 
		headlamps, and motorcycles manufactured on or after January 1, 1978, must 
		have headlamps that activate automatically whenever the motor is running. 
		Motorcycles must also have one or more taillamps that are red in color and 
		plainly visible from all distances within 1,000 feet to the rear (500 feet 
		if the motorcycle was manufactured on or before January 1, 1969).</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>California Motorcyclist Safety Program (CMSP)</strong> 
		is California's official motorcycle safety and training program. CMSP 
		offers the Basic RiderCourse for beginning riders of all ages. However, 
		motorcyclists under 21 years of age are required to complete an 
		approved course before they may apply for a permit, and must hold a 
		permit for 6 months before a motorcycle license can be issued. A Basic 
		RiderCourse provides five hours of classroom instruction and ten hours 
		of practical riding exercises in a controlled, off-street environment 
		(motorcycles and helmets are provided free of charge for use during 
		the course). Successful completion of the course may waive the riding 
		skills test requirement at the DMV (new cyclists must still pass the 
		written exam prior to receiving their motorcycle endorsement). The 
		Experienced RiderCourse offers advanced techniques to motorcyclists who 
		are interested in improving their skills, and these half-day courses 
		may qualify graduates for an insurance premium discount. Contact CMSP 
		at 1-877-RIDE-411 for more information, or browse to <a target="_blank"

		</div>
		
		<h4>Oversized Vehicles</h4>
		
		<p>Drivers of oversized vehicles have large blind spots directly in 
		front, to the rear, and to the sides. You'll want to give them plenty 
		of space so they don't unwittingly run you over. Oversized vehicles 
		also present a hazard&mdash;especially near intersections&mdash;because 
		they may inhibit your view of oncoming and cross traffic. Stay well 
		back from large vehicles so that you can see everything you need to see 
		in order to drive safely. Remember that defensive driving entails both 
		seeing and being seen.</p>
		
		<p>Beware also of oversized vehicles turning in front of you. Oversized 
		vehicles can experience what is called <em>tail swing</em>. This means 
		that the rear of the turning vehicle travels to the outside of the 
		turning radius. Sometimes this action can cause the rear of the vehicle 
		to swing out several feet into the adjacent lane. Do not try to pass as 
		an oversized vehicle is making its turn, or you could find yourself 
		unexpectedly rear-ending it.</p>
